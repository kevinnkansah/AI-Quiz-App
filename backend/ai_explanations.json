[{"id": 1, "explanation": "The 'Present Perfect' tense is incorrect because it typically expresses completed actions in the past that had a connection to the present. The correct answer is 'Present Continuous', which describes repeated or habitual actions in the past, as seen in examples like 'I always eat breakfast'."}, {"id": 2, "explanation": "The phrase \"I have been to Rome for years\" is incorrect because it implies a past continuous or completed action that started in the past but extends into the present. The correct translation of \"Sono arrivato a Roma ieri\" is \"I went to Rome yesterday\", which correctly conveys a completed action in the past, referring specifically to one day prior to the current moment."}, {"id": 3, "explanation": "The Past Perfect Continuous tense is incorrect because it implies an action started in the past and ended at another specific time in the past, which doesn't match its actual purpose.\n\nThe correct answer, 'Completed actions before another past event', accurately describes the Past Perfect Continuous tense's function: to emphasize an ongoing action that had already completed by a previous point in the past."}, {"id": 4, "explanation": "Close Reading is incorrect because it involves in-depth analysis of a text's details, rather than making a general impression of its main ideas. Skimming and scanning is correct because it allows readers to quickly grasp the overall meaning and structure of a text without getting bogged down in every detail."}]
