[{"id": 1, "explanation": "The Present Continuous tense incorrectly describes completed past actions because it expresses ongoing or continuous actions in the present, not finished ones. The Past Simple tense accurately describes completed past actions because it uses verbs that end in -ed or -d to form a regular verb pattern for completed actions in the past."}, {"id": 4, "explanation": "The statement \"I'll meet my friend tomorrow\" implies that the meeting already exists in the future. However, it does not provide any information about its current status or whether it actually will happen.\n\nThe correct answer should state if the meeting is scheduled for the future, implying a confirmed plan and indicating when it will take place."}, {"id": 6, "explanation": "Contextual Clues involves analyzing individual words within a sentence to understand their meaning, rather than quickly scanning text for main ideas. Skimming is the correct answer because it specifically involves rapidly scanning text to grasp the overall idea or summary of the material."}, {"id": 7, "explanation": "The term 'Modal Verb' does not describe verbs that combine with prepositions or adverbs because modal verbs have their own distinct function in expressing possibility, necessity, and ability. Phrasal Verbs, on the other hand, do combine with prepositions or adverbs to form new verb phrases with specific meanings."}]
