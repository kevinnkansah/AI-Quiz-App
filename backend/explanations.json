[{"id": 1, "explanation": "Future Perfect tense incorrectly describes completed past actions, as it implies an action that started in the future and was completed by then. Past Simple correctly describes completed past actions, accurately indicating that the action occurred at some point in the past without any connection to the future."}, {"id": 2, "explanation": "The incorrect answer 'I have been to Italy for two weeks' is not in the correct form because the verb 'to be' must agree with the subject in terms of tense.\n\nThe correct answer 'I was in Italy for two weeks' uses the past perfect tense, which accurately reflects a completed action that started before another action in the past."}, {"id": 3, "explanation": "Future actions cannot be described with the Past Perfect tense because it indicates an action occurred before another past event, not after.\n\nThe correct answer is \"Completed actions before another past event\" because it accurately conveys that one completed action took place before another past action had occurred."}, {"id": 6, "explanation": "Contextual Clues involves analyzing individual words for their meanings in relation to surrounding text, which does not align with scanning text for the main idea. Skimming, on the other hand, quickly scans text for the main idea without close attention to detail or analysis of specific words."}, {"id": 7, "explanation": "The user's answer \"Modal Verb\" is incorrect because Modal Verbs are used to express possibility, necessity, or permission, not to combine with prepositions or adverbs.\n\nPhrasal Verb is the correct answer because it specifically refers to verbs that join with prepositions or adverbs to create a new phrase with a specific meaning, such as \"pick up\" or \"get on\"."}]
